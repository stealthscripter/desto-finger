          In Ethiopia, there's a cultural tendency to reshape foreign words and
          ideas, making them uniquely Ethiopian. For instance, the word
          "congratulations" is commonly shortened to "congra," and the name "Bob
          Marley" is often referred to as "Bomb Marly." This cultural
          adaptability extends to everything, including music, language, and
          even games.

          During the five-year Italian occupation of Ethiopia (1936â€“1941), this
          ability to reshape and adapt foreign influences led to the
          transformation of a simple <i>just finger can count </i> song into the
          game Desto Finger Caw Cawter Oli

          The song, originally in English, was converted into an Ethiopian
          version, and the game itself was invented during the early years of
          the occupation by combining the just finger can count song and the
          Italian hand game Morra which has roots in ancient Roman and Greek
          times. This fusion of elements created something new yet familiar,
          reflecting the blend of cultures.
